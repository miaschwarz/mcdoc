        <h1>Critique of Yelp</h1>
        <p>
            Yelp is among the top food review apps available to download with over 70 million users on their mobile app.
            Their idea was simple, one place for users to go to find reviews on restaurants and determine if it was worth
            trying.

                <p>
                    Lots of filters in order to decide the best fit for you.

                    Has become more than just restaurant reviews, users can now find virtually any type of establishment.

                    Buisnnesses are able to verify themselves and have more of an online presence in order to help themselves grow.

            <p style="border-top: 1px solid black; padding-top: 25px; text-align: center;">Overall Yelp does exactly what you would want and expect it to however buisnnesses are able to pay to promote themselves
                while the main goal of Foodie is to get genuine reccomendations from friends or peers. That idea is lost when it comes to
                successfuil apps like Yelp, they no longer care how honest or real a review is, the main focus is to get more users or
                for buinesses to promote themselves.
